# 🟢 Simon Game (Practice Project)

A basic web-based version of the classic **Simon Game**, built using **HTML**, **CSS**, and mostly **JavaScript**.  
This project was made for learning and practicing core JavaScript concepts like event handling, arrays, functions, and game logic.

## 🎯 Purpose

This is a simple practice project to improve my JavaScript skills by building a small interactive game.

## 🚀 Technologies Used

- HTML5
- CSS3 (basic styling)
- JavaScript (main focus)

## 🎮 How to Play

1. Press any key (or click "Start") to begin the game.
2. A random color will flash — remember the sequence.
3. Click the buttons in the same order.
4. If you're correct, the game continues with an additional color in the sequence.
5. If you're wrong, the game resets and you can try again.

## 📌 Features

- Basic random sequence generation
- Tracks player input and checks against the correct pattern
- Game reset on wrong input
- Simple level tracking
- No external libraries used
